# Retail Liquor Sales Analysis (Python)

## Overview
This project analyzes retail liquor sales data from Iowa in order to extract business insights from transactional data.  
The analysis focuses on identifying top-selling products across regions and understanding store revenue contribution using Python-based data processing and visualization tools.

The workflow includes data cleaning, aggregation, exploratory analysis, and visualization.

## Objectives

The project aims to:

- Clean and preprocess real-world transactional data  
- Identify the most popular item in each zip code  
- Measure the revenue contribution of each store  
- Perform exploratory analysis to detect patterns in sales  
- Visualize results to support business decision-making  

---

## Tools & Technologies

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Plotly  

---

## Dataset

The dataset contains retail liquor sales transactions, including:

- Store information  
- Product categories  
- Sales quantities  
- Revenue values  
- Geographic identifiers (zip code, county, etc.)

A sample dataset is included for demonstration purposes.

## Analysis Performed

### 1. Most Popular Item per Zip Code
The script aggregates total bottles sold per product within each zip code and identifies the top-selling item in every region.  
The results are visualized using an interactive scatter plot.

This demonstrates:
- Grouping and aggregation logic  
- Sorting and filtering operations  
- Regional demand analysis  

---

### 2. Store Revenue Share
The script calculates the total revenue generated by each store and computes the percentage contribution to overall sales.  
The results are displayed using horizontal bar charts.

This demonstrates:
- Revenue normalization  
- Percentage calculations  
- Comparative store performance visualization
